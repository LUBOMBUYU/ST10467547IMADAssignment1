## 🎨 Design Considerations
- User Interface (UI):
The app uses bright and vibrant colours. It also uses a lot of background images that give a plesant display

- User Experience (UX):
The app only requires users to enter the time.
A straightforward flow ensures users never feel lost.
Users can tap meal images to get descriptions, making the app engaging.
If users enter an invalid time, the app provides a friendly prompt to re-enter a correct value.

- Performance Optimization:
Used ConstraintLayout for a flexible yet optimized interface.
Compressed images ensure fast loading without sacrificing quality.
The app avoids unnecessary computations by using simple conditional (while) statements.
Ensured smooth navigation by preventing UI lag with Kotlin coroutines where needed.
